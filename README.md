# Machine Learning Blogs

I like to write technical blogs on machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression.
This repo contains the code I've used to explain and run through examples when discussing these machine learning algorithms.

Check out the finished product on my blog [here](https://philliplagoc.wordpress.com/blog/)!
